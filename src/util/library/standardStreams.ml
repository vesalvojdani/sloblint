(** The C library's standard streams [stdin], [stdout] and [stderr].

    The C standard declares each as an expression of type [FILE *] that points
    to a stream object owned by the library; glibc declares each as an
    [extern FILE *] variable of the same name, and Darwin as one named
    [__stdoutp] and so on ({!of_name}). The analysis gives each stream an
    object of its own, a global variable named ["[stdout]"] and so on
    ({!object_var}), and at program start sets the declared variable to its
    address. Nothing in the C library assigns these variables afterwards, so
    unlike other [extern] variables they are not treated as changing
    unpredictably ({!BaseUtil.is_always_unknown}); an assignment by the
    program itself is analyzed as any other. Where a C library names the
    variables otherwise, they are not recognized and hold unknown addresses,
    so every call through them reports writing through an unknown address.

    {b What the object holds.} The only part of a stream's state that is
    program memory is the buffer that [setvbuf], [setbuf] or [setbuffer]
    handed it, which later stream functions read and write until the stream
    is closed or the program exits. The object is therefore a [void *]
    holding that buffer, or null while the stream uses a buffer of the
    library's own; the objects are initialized to null wherever the file uses
    the standard streams ({!LibraryFunctions.standard_streams_used}),
    declared or not. Only those three functions and [fclose] store into an
    object ({!LibraryDesc.special.SetStreamBuffer}): they add to what it
    holds, except that a call on one definite stream replaces it.

    {b What a library call does to it.} A library function with a
    specification in {!LibraryFunctions} that reads or writes through a
    stream, however deep its specification says, writes the bytes of the
    buffer the object holds, and nothing the buffer's contents point to, and
    leaves the object itself as it is ([Base.invalidate] with
    [keep_streams]). A function that uses a stream without taking it as an
    argument, as [printf] uses [stdout], carries
    {!LibraryDesc.attr.UsesStream} and does the same to that stream, and
    [fflush] given a stream that may be null
    ({!LibraryDesc.attr.AllStreamsIfNull}) to all three. Each access to a
    buffer is reported as an [Access] event of its own
    ([AccessAnalysis.do_access]), so [useAfterFree] and the race analysis
    check it. The objects themselves are never data races
    ({!Access.is_ignorable_mval}): only [SetStreamBuffer] writes one, and the
    C library serializes the calls on a stream.

    {b Functions without a specification.} Such a function may assign the
    variables and hand any stream any buffer. Where it invalidates the
    globals, as by default, it sets the declared stream variables and the
    objects to unknown values, so a later stream function writes through an
    unknown address and says so. Where it does not, a stream object reachable
    from its arguments comes to hold every object the function reaches.

    {b The buffer's lifetime.} A stream may use its buffer until it is
    closed, at the latest in the flush and close when the program exits, so
    storage a stream still holds as its buffer must not end first. For a
    standard stream [Base] reports a [UseAfterFree] warning where it does: at
    the return of a function whose local a stream holds (for [main], before
    [exit] flushes, C11 5.1.2.2.3), at a [longjmp] that leaves such a
    function, at [free] or [realloc] of heap memory a stream holds or of a
    pointer whose target is not known while a stream holds heap memory, at
    [pthread_exit] in any thread, [main]'s included, while a stream holds a
    local of any function or thread-local storage, and where a thread other
    than the main one returns while a stream holds thread-local storage.
    [pthread_exit] warns for every local, since the frames on the exiting
    thread's stack are not known, except a local of [main] where that thread
    is known not to be the main one and [main] has frames only on the main
    thread's stack ({!main_frame_only_on_main_thread}). [fclose] detaches the
    buffer.

    Where the end of the storage may not be one of those, [SetStreamBuffer]
    reports the assumption {!buffer_lifetime} instead: for a stream that may
    be other than a standard stream any buffer but static storage, heap
    memory included; and for a standard stream an unknown address, [alloca]
    memory, thread-local storage (whose thread may be cancelled), a local
    that may be declared in a nested block (unless [cil.addNestedScopeAttr]
    shows it is not), a variable-length array, whose lifetime also ends where
    a [goto] jumps back before its declaration, and any local where the
    program may call [pthread_cancel] ({!program_may_cancel}), whose thread's
    frames end without a return or a [pthread_exit].

    {b Other streams.} A stream that is not a standard one, such as one
    [fopen] returned, has an unknown address, so [SetStreamBuffer] records
    its buffer nowhere and later calls on it do not write the buffer; only
    the message that the call writes through an unknown address covers
    that. *)
